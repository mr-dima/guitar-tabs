Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a  
One horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one  
Horse open sleigh  

Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the hills we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on Bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a  
One horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one  
Horse open sleigh  

Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sliegh  
Over the hills we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on Bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a  
One horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way
