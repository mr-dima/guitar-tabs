# [Bon Jovi - Runaway](tabs.md)

On the streets where you live girls talk about their social lives  
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes  
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you?  
But you were livin' in another world tryna get a message through  

No one heard a single word you said  
They should have seen it in your eyes  
What was goin' around your head?  

Ooh, she's a little runaway  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
All those things he couldn't say  
Ooh-ooh, she's a little runaway  

A different line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind  
I see you out on the streets, call me for a wild time  
So you sit home alone 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do  
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you  
You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign?  
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find  

Ooh, she's a little runaway  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
All those things he couldn't say  
Ooh-ooh, she's a little runaway  
No one heard a single word you said  
They should have seen it in your eyes (seen it in your eyes)  
What was goin' around your head?  

Ooh, she's a little runaway  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
All those things he couldn't say  
Ooh, she's a little runaway  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
Now she works the night away  

Ahh, little runaway (ooh, she's a little runaway)  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
And now she's a runaway (all those things he couldn't say)  
Woo, little runaway (ooh, she's a little runaway)  
Daddy's girl learned fast  
And now she's a runaway (now she works the night away)  
(Ooh, she's a little runaway)
