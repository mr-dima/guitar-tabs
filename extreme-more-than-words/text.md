Saying "I love you"  
Is not the words I want to hear from you  
It's not that I want you  
Not to say but if you only knew  

How easy, it would be to show me how you feel  
More than words is all you have to do to make it real  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
'Cause I'd already know  

What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two?  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say  
If I took those words away?  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying "I love you"  

La-di-da, da-di-da  
Di-dai-dai-da  
More than words  
La-di-da, da-di-da  

Now that I've tried to  
Talk to you and make you understand  
All you have to do is close your eyes  
And just reach out your hands and touch me  

Hold me close, don't ever let me go  
More than words is all I ever needed you to show  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
'Cause I'd already know  

What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two?  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say  
If I took those words away?  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying "I love you"
