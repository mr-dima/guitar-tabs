# [Panic! At the Disco - House of Memories](tabs.md)

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

If you're a lover, you should know  
The lonely moments just get lonelier  
The longer you're in love  
Than if you were alone  
Memories turn into daydreams  
Become a taboo  

I don't want to be afraid  
The deeper that I go  
It takes my breath away  
Soft hearts, electric souls  
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes  
Is this taboo?  

Baby, we built this house on memories  
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it  
And when your fantasies become your legacy  
Promise me a place in your house of memories  

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

I think of you from time to time  
More than I thought I would  
You were just too kind  
And I was too young to know  
That's all that really matters  
I was a fool  

Baby, we built this house on memories  
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it  
And when your fantasies become your legacy  
Promise me a place in your house of memories  

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me  
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me  
Then will you remember me in the same way  
As I remember you?  

Baby, we built this house on memories  
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it  
And when your fantasies become your legacy  
Promise me a place  

Baby, we built this house on memories  
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it  
And when your fantasies become your legacy  
Promise me a place in your house of memories  

In your house of memories (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Promise me a place (whoa-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
