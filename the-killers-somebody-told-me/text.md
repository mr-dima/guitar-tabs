Breakin' my back just to know your name  
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game  
A breakin' my back just to know your name  
But Heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss  
'Cause Heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said Heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (hoo hoo)  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  

Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  

Ready let's roll onto something new  
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you  
'Cause Heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said Heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (hoo hoo)  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  

Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  

A rushing, rushing around  

Pace yourself for me (for me)  
I said maybe, baby, please (please)  
But I just don't know now (baby, baby)  
When all I want to do is try  

Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  

A rushing, rushing around  

Now somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  

A rushing, rushing around  

Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  

A rushing, rushing around
