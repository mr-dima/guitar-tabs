# [Teddy Swims - Bad Dreams](tabs.md)

Sun is going down, time is running out  
No one else around but me  
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind  
Moving shadows and grinding teeth, ooh  

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide  
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight  
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet  
Without you, I keep  

Slippin' into bad dreams  
Where there's no you in I  
No sound when I cry  
I love you and I need you to set me free  
From all of these bad dreams (bad dreams)  

Waiting on the other side  
No sound when I cry  
I love you and I need you to set me free  
From all of these, all of these  

Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Bad dreams  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
All of these  

Baby, please come around, help me settle down  
Hellish habits can cloud my head (ooh-ooh)  
What you waiting for? Something physical  
I can't do this by myself  

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide  
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight  
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet  
Without you, I keep  

Slippin' into bad dreams  
Where there's no you in I  
No sound when I cry  
I love you and I need you to set me free (to set me free)  
From all of these (all of these)  

Bad dreams waiting on the other side  
No sound when I cry  
I love you and I need you to set me free (set me free)  
From all of these, all of these  

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Bad dreams  
Baby, please  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
All of these (baby, please), all of these  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
