Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought me some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  

When we finally said goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  

And the fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you'd love me so  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  

How I hate going out in the storm  
(But if you really grab me tight)  
Well, all the way home I'll be warm  

Oh, the fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you'd love me so  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  

It's snowing!
