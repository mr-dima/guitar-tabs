Come along, down with me  
You're not alone, you will see  
The children, they have each other  
And each other is all they need  

In the hour of joy in this paradise  
I thought about all that could have been  
If we had never done the things we did  
If we had realized all our sins  

Come along, down with me (come along, come a-, come along)  
You're not alone, you will see (come along, come a-, come along)  
We children, we have each other  
And each other is all we need  

In the hour of joy, in the hour of joy  
In the hour of joy, in the hour of joy  
In the hour of joy, in the hour of joy  
In the hour of joy, in the hour of joy  
In the hour of joy, in the hour of joy  

Artificial façade from a fraud of a God  
All due to the path that we trod  
We just wanted to heal, but now our nightmares are real  
And now we'll never wake up, for we've torn apart  
We want freedom, freedom  
Freedom, freedom, freedom (we all fall down)  
We'll sleep well now, dream dreams knocked out  
New blooms when Playtime sprouts  

Come along, go to sleep (come along, come a-, come along)  
And leave here without a trace (come along, come a-, come along)  
Though life in the shadows isn't much  
It's better than living in a cage  

Can you see us?  
Can you hear us?

Freedom, freedom, freedom (we all fall down)
