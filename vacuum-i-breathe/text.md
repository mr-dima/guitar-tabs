I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I load lead inside my engine
Lead and alcohol
On the radio depending
I sign the protocol
Hail the audience, the media, people everywhere
In the hours ahead I'll see your...

Green biosphere
Clean biosphere
Castles in air
Climbing the stair
Way to Heaven when

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I've been trained to navigate my futurist balloon
After years a week will see me landing on the moon
Raise a banner on the planets
Life grows everywhere
In the manner of the mission

Green biosphere
Clean biosphere
Castles in air
Climbing the stair
Way to Heaven when

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high

I breathe clouds beneath my window
I see rockets in the sky
I feel satellites in limbo
I breathe oxygen up high
