# [Limp Bizkit - Behind blue eyes](tabs.md)

No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
And no one knows what it's like  
To be hated  
To be fated to telling only lies  

But my dreams they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  

No one knows what it's like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you (you, you, you)  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  

But my dreams they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  

No one knows what it's like  
To be mistreated, to be defeated  
Behind blue eyes  
And no one knows how to say  
That they're sorry and don't worry  
I'm not telling lies  

But my dreams, they aren't as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
I have hours, only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
That's never free  

No one knows what it's like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes
