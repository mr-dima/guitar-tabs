# [Alanis Morissette - What If God Was One Of Us](tabs.md)

If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to His face, if you were faced with Him?
And all His glory, what would you ask if you had just one question?

Yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger among us
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you wanna see? If seeing meant you had to believe
in things like Heaven, and in Jesus and the Saints, and all the prophets.

Yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God is good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger among us
Trying to make His way home

Just trying to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone,
except the Pope maybe in Rome.

Yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God is good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger among us
Trying to make His way home

Just trying to make His way home
Like a Holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone

Just trying to make His way home
Nobody calling on the phone,
except the Pope maybe in Rome.
