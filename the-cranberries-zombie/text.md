# [The Cranberries - Zombie](tabs.md)

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are crying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie, oh

Do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do-do, do

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, eh-ah, ya-ya-ow
