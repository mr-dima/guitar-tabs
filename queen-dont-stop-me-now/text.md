# [Queen - Don't Stop Me Now](tabs.md)

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time  
I feel alive  
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah  
And floating around in ecstasy, so  
(Don't stop me now)  
(Don't stop me)  
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time  

I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky  
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity  
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva  
I'm gonna go, go, go  
There's no stopping me  

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm traveling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you  

I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball  
(Don't stop me now)  
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call  
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time  
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm havin' a good time  
I don't want to stop at all, yeah  

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars  
On a collision course  
I am a satellite, I'm out of control  
I am a sex machine, ready to reload  
Like an atom bomb  
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh explode  

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm traveling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you  

Hey, hey, hey  
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I like it  
(Don't stop me, don't stop me)  
Have a good time, good time  
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Ah  
Oh yeah  
Alright  

Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm traveling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you  

I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball  
(Don't stop me now)  
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call  
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time  
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm havin' a good time  
I don't want to stop at all
